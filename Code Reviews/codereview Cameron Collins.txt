Comments:
   1. The existence of ProjectileStats.cs bewilders me. Wouldn't it be better to
      instantiate stats in IProjectile.cs and define the values in ProjectileManager.cs?
      Maybe the intention is to futureproof IProjectile if we wanted to add more types
      of stats, but... I'm not seeing how that would be a problem.

   2. As mentioned before, fired projectiles need to be despawned after an amount of
      time, at the very least after leaving the active game area.
    
   3. BasicWeapon.cs seems to be acting as both a placeholder weapon and a WeaponManager 
      class. We're implementing four different weapon types, so a WeaponManager will be
      mandatory.

Suggested changes:
   1. Implement the functionality of ProjectileStats.cs into IProjectile.cs and
      ProjectileManager.cs

   2. Implement a check to see if a projectile is outside the active game area, and call
      Discontinue() if so.
         (Optional) Implement a stat that calls Discontinue() if the projectile is active for 
         a given amount of time.
   
   3. Create a WeaponManager
